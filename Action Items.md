Iterms to do, as of 12/2/18:

1. Reactome - describes molecular level reactions in a systematic way to generate an ordered network of molecular transformations. Millions of interconnections, forming a graph of biological knowledge. For data retrieval, and interpretation and analysis of pathway knowledge. Uses Neo4J (with a graphical database vs relational database) - for effective modeling of highly interconnected data. Seems similar to JSON. 

Go thtrough the Sem Web Programming book - go through tree vs graph. alignment is easy...

At the Neo4J browser - neo4j.com/developer/cypher, use cyperh query language and their tutorial. Extract participation molecules. /der/graph-database/e...p...m . Neo4J seemed to have a 30 day limit. look into that. Twitter/reactome for latest info. 

Read Reactome graph db: Efficient access to complex pathway data. API for Java library at Github.

2. Ch. 2 example from Sem Web Progr - ontology, Dbs, reasoning --> use the info they provide. 
3. Try Python/R examples/codes
4. Primer on Ontologies - Ch1/GO book
5. Expand on metabolic, signaling, adn inflammation pathways.
6. Showcase BRCA2 analysis in Ch. 20; may need visualization discussed in Ch. 15-semantic simalarity analysis.

  Many tools listed in p. 210 - Show KEGG, SimCT, Cytoscope + Plugins, QuickGo, OLVis (other Ontos), AmiGO2, REVIGO, Gorilla, GoSummaries.

Enrichment analysis - example; Shankar - teacher, researcher, GO..; Student - student, engineer, professional, teacher, GO....
enrichment with GO - P not significant. Many high level terms - make discrimination less useful (higher terms have poor information value); on the other hand, is the segway to gaining biological insight. 

Reference to context - Client to his attorney: Status? Attorney: Good - it is over; Bad news - it is over. Reference is important (good vs bad categorization). In GO: Cellular components for location, as an example.

7. Python/R - Ch. 16 + Bioconductor
8. Get papers: #6, 12, 13, & 14 - p. 204/205 - FPs due to the open world assumption
   #42 - p. 287 - How EHR data is used
9. P. 292 - working on pitfalls. Download uniprot in owl tool. p. 45 - visualize the 3 GO IDs.
   P. 298 - Deine high throughput experiments.
   
10. An iterative example: say a social scientist found that 'people in well-lit communities live longer.' Community genome! Was it well-lit be the community or the cops (because of high crime); is it because it is a rich community?; is the longevity due to reduced crime, better co-located advantages (drinking water, air pollution, schools, etc.,). This example is for 'The good correlation is observational, not experimental' (since all other variables are controlled) - an early chapter statement in the GO book.
11. Machine learning evaluation metrics - important - ROC, and precision-recall curve.  Pitfalls and remedies - P. 202
