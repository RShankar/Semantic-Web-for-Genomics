See install.md for instructions to install R, R Studio, and Bioconductor. 
I have included GoFunction information; not used in topGo, but will read it later and apply.

topGo uses org.Hs.eg.db - which is "Genome wide annotation for Human, primarily based on mapping using Entrez Gene identifiers."

topGo's tutorial in PDF and my R code for the 'Quick Start' are enclosed. The tutorial is based on an article (enclosed) which identified differential gene profiles for ALL patients that may help personalize therapy to improve survival. 

Note: There is an omission in the tutorial. The function colMap() is not provided. It was available here: https://rpubs.com/aemoore62/TopGo_colMap_Func_Troubleshoot. My code has that included. I tried to communicate this to the author, but the web address given is incorrect.
