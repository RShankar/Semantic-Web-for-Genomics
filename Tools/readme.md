My experience so far indicates that R is much better than Python for genomics analysis, in terms of the ease of setting up a productive environemnt for research explorations. The whole process was highly predictable with easy-to-use tutorial and reference documents in support. See the Bioconductor website for R;  biopython for Python seems to be a similar destination. Python also changed radically when they moved from Version 2 to 3; in order to use many of the Python 2 packages in Python 3, there are additional downloads. 

The GO Handbook uses Python in Chapter 16 to demonstrate enrichment analysis. Such enrichment analysis and visualization can also be done in R. Plan to rewrite with R.
