I have documented four courses here, three at the graduate level, and one at the undergraduate level. One graduate course was taught during the spring '19 semester. It focused on the application of Gene Ontology (GO) for genome to phenome mapping. All student work documented at this GitHub site so far is based on this course (as of June 2019). 

The undergraduate course will focus on chip design at the system level, with the intent to build eventually a personalized chip that mimics the individualâ€™s genome and phenome perspectives; the chip / model will act as a reference for medical decision making. One of the graduate courses, Computational Genomics, will focus on building computational models for various key biological pathways. The second graduate course is a state-of-the-art overview course; it builds a hierarchical multi-layer model to integrate all the concepts and develop a contemporary perspective of genomics analysis. 

All the four syllabi are included here.
