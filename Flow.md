Typical flow:
1. Review of literature, case-control animal/clinical studies
2. Decide on a gene/gene product set (the minimal set)
3. Do GO term enrichment analysis
4. Decide on BP, MF, and CC relevance. Hypothesize. It is likely you will have additions to info from #1
5. Literature review of GWAS studies (likely from Next Generation Sequencing)
6. Decide on the 'maximal' gene/gene product set
7. Do Go term enrichment analysis
8. Decide on BP, MF, and CC relevance. Hypothesize. 
9. Propose case-control knockout/experimental animal (rabbit, monkey) / human clinical studies. 
10. **Beyond the course**: Apply for grants: (a) NSF/NIH provide 3-5 year research shcolarships to students; you get to choose where you will do research); (b) most federal agencies provide SBIR (small business innovative research) grants (Phase I and II). $100K and $1M.
