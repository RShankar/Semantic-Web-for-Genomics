This series, entitled "Current Topics in Genome Analysis 2016"  were recorded at NIH in 2016. Here is the [link](https://www.genome.gov/12514288/current-topics-in-genome-analysis-2016-course-syllabus-handouts-and-videos/).

I found all of them interesting and useful. However, a few of those videos are directly relevant to this course. Video links are provided here. Slides are found in this folder.
