This series, entitled "Current Topics in Genome Analysis 2016"  were recorded at NIH in 2016. Here is the [link](https://www.genome.gov/12514288/current-topics-in-genome-analysis-2016-course-syllabus-handouts-and-videos/).

I found all of them interesting and useful. However, a few of those videos are directly relevant to this course. Video links are provided here. Slides are found in this folder. Slides for Lecture 7 (Population Genetics) not included here (too big). I have also included my notes and explorations based on the lectures. 

* Biological Sequence Analysis, Part 1, Lec 1: Sequence Similarity and Homology. To derive biological inferences with regard to: structural, functional, and evolutionary relationships. Local sequence alignment performed, using scoring matrices that depend upon  physicochemicla and biological characteristics (charge, size, and hyrophobicity, and frequency among all proteins) of nucleotides and amino acids. Blosum 60 default filter. Try a higher and a lower one. Intro to BLAST. Many papers have misinterpreted the results. Guidelines provided on avoiding such situations: Calculate E, a statistical measure that depends on the # of letters in query and database, and normalized score. It represents the number of High-scoring segment pairs (HSPs) found purely by chance. so, lower values signify higher similarity. Good: E < 10<sup>-6</sup> for nucleotides; and < 10,sup>-3,/sup> for proteins.
