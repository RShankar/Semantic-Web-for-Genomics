There are many tools at various websites that can be daunting for a beginner. One specific site illustrates the way a site can be made useful and friendly: [REVIGO](http://revigo.irb.hr/). Our hope is to develop tutorials that will provide this bridge, in our focus area. Our focus here is on: Protege, AmiGO2, QuickGO, REVIGO, and Reactome for the static aspects of biological pathway annotation; and BioPax, SBGN, and SBML for dynamic aspects of biological pathway annotation. We also wish, eventually, to link various databases and other ontologies, as depicted in Chapter 20 of the [GO book](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-3743-1.pdf) .

This linkage requires a Java framework implemented with [OWL API](http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/sites/default/files/swj107_2.pdf). The authors offered a [course](http://syllabus.cs.manchester.ac.uk/pgt/2017/COMP62342/introduction-owl-api-msc.pdf) in 2016 at the U of Manchester. A short tutorial is found [here](https://github.com/owlcs/owlapi/wiki/Tutorial:-A-starter%27s-starter). A good introductory book on semantic web programming is by [Hebeler et al](https://www.amazon.com/Semantic-Web-Programming-John-Hebeler/dp/047041801X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1541098931&sr=1-1&keywords=semantic+web+programming). The Table of Content is found [here](https://sisis.rz.htw-berlin.de/inh2009/12372048.pdf). We have done much work in this area, albeit in areas other than genomics.
