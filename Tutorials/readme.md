There are many tools at various websites that can be daunting for a beginner. One specific site illustrates the way a site can be made useful and friendly: [REVIGO](http://revigo.irb.hr/). Our hope is to develop tutorials that will provide this bridge, in our focus area. Our initial focus here is on: Protege, AmiGO2, QuickGO, REVIGO, and Reactome for the static aspects of biological pathway annotation; and BioPax, SBGN, and SBML for dynamic aspects of biological pathway annotation. We also wish, eventually, to link various databases and other ontologies, as depicted in Chapter 20 of the [GO book](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-3743-1.pdf) .

This linkage requires a Java framework implemented with [OWL API](http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/sites/default/files/swj107_2.pdf). The authors offered a [course](http://syllabus.cs.manchester.ac.uk/pgt/2017/COMP62342/introduction-owl-api-msc.pdf) in 2016 at the U of Manchester. A short tutorial is found [here](https://github.com/owlcs/owlapi/wiki/Tutorial:-A-starter%27s-starter). A good introductory book on semantic web programming is by [Hebeler et al](https://www.amazon.com/Semantic-Web-Programming-John-Hebeler/dp/047041801X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1541098931&sr=1-1&keywords=semantic+web+programming). The Table of Content is found [here](https://sisis.rz.htw-berlin.de/inh2009/12372048.pdf). We have done much work in this area, albeit in areas other than genomics. Link to our website is [here](http://semanticweb.fau.edu/). The databases to be linked for GO related studies are: HPO (Human Phenotype Ontology) and DO (Disease Ontology), as well as clinical databases accessible through [UMLS](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/) managed by NLM at NIH. Genotype and genomic variation databases and datasets are available through [NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/). 

The next stage of research and development will require active support for dynamic biological pathway modeling and appropriate annotations from experimental studies. This will need exposure to SBML, SBGN, and BioPax. These are all languages and tools for visualization only. Recently, U of Edinburgh has improved on this biological pathway visualization by developing a Petri-net based executable model. See [O'Hara et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4980033/). Our intent is to develop a SystemC-based model for this. For more on our work on that, see [here](https://github.com/shankar4/Functional-Model).
