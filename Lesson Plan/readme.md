A graduate level course is scheduled to be taught at Florida Atlantic University in Spring 2019. Here is the proposed lesson plan (for 90 minute lectures). See the **Examples and Tools sections** for several worked out examples. All the books / papers referenced are free to download and are included in the References section :

* Lec 1- Genome Primer (Page 10 /preface) from M. Ridley's book: Genome - The Autobiography of a Species in 23 chapters; Chapter 1 (The first look at a genome: sequence statistics) from Cristianini and Hahn's book: Introduction to Computational Genomics. GC content mapper and FASTA data format. 
* Lec 2 - Gene Finding (Chapter 2 in C&H on: All the sequence's men - Gene finding). ORF Threshold with ORF Finder; Sequence Alignment (Chapter 3 in C&H on: All in the family - Sequence alignment). PAX and HOX domains in the *eyeless* gene of a fruitfly. Use of GO TermFinder to understand their role in biological processes. Use of AmiGO 2 to browse the GO hierarchy and to determine orthologs. Use of BLAST to compare two orthologs
* Lec 3 - Gene Ontology (Chapter 2) from Dessimoz and Skunca's book: The Gene Ontology Handbook. Use of GO for enrichment analysis. See the Summaries section for summaries of a book on EST (expressed sequence tags) and enrichment analysis software. See Tools/Papers for the latter paper on software. Application of an ontology: [Automotive Ontology community group](https://www.w3.org/community/gao/), [Generic Automotive Ontology](https://schema.org/docs/automotive.html), [Examples](https://schema.org/docs/automotive.html#used_car),  [Toyota application](
* Lec 4 - GO Annotations (Chapter 3) from the GO book. See Tools/Papers section for a 2008 paper on  use and misuse of GO annotations.
