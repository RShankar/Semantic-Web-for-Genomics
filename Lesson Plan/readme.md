A graduate level course is scheduled to be taught at Florida Atlantic University in Spring 2019. Here is the proposed lesson plan (for 90 minute lectures). See the Examples and Tools section for several worked out examples. All the books references are free to download and are included in the References section :

* Lec 1- Genome Primer (Page 10 /preface) from M. Ridley's book: Genome - The Autobiography of a Species in 23 chapters; Chapter 1 (The first look at a genome: sequence statistics) from Cristianini and Hahn's book: Introduction to Computational Genomics. GC content mapper and FASTA data format. 
* Lec 2 - Gene Finding (Chapter 2 in C&H on: All the sequence's men - Gene finding). ORF Threshold with ORF Finder; Sequence Alignment (Chapter 3 in C&H on: All in the family - Sequence alignment). PAX and HOX domains in the *eyeless* gene of a fruitfly. Use of GO TermFinder to understand their role in biological processes. Use of AmiGO 2 to browse the GO hierarchy and to determine orthologs. Use of BLAST to compare two orthologs
