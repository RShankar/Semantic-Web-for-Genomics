[Schema.org](https://schema.org/) "is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond." It is founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex. Schema.org vocabularies are developed by an open community process.

An example shown here is for marking up automobile data on Internet pages for automobiles. [Automobile Ontology Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/gao/) has developed the Generic Auto Ontology (GAO) that is incorporated into the multiple ontologies available at Schema.org. The specific [GAO ontology](https://schema.org/docs/automotive.html) is designed to be embedded directly in existing web pages. Schema.org already has several related ontologies, such as the Vehicle Sales Ontology (VSO), Car Options Ontology (COO) and Used Cars Ontology (UCO). Their webpage documents [3 examples](https://schema.org/docs/automotive.html#usage_examples) of embedding schema.org data into webpages as part of the html markup. The European division of Toyota has started embedding GAO in their [webpages](https://www.toyota-europe.com/). here is a snapshot (as a web page and with html exposed with schema.org **annotation**):

**How will it appear on the web pages?**: The web page will look the same. However, the underlying html document will differ. Examples in the "Example Web pages" document the illustrative example given [here](https://schema.org/docs/automotive.html#usage_examples). 

**How will this be used?** Internet Bots (automated software) can download the embedded information automatically to create a table that lists similar features across different car manufacturers and brands. 

Another relevant example: Travel sites such as [Travelocity](https://www.travelocity.com/).
