Web Pages in html from [here](https://schema.org/docs/automotive.html#usage_examples): Pre-markup; microdata markup; and RDFa markup. 
How to create these html pages: Open Wordpad, copy and paste the document, and 'save as'  with the extension of .html (not .html.txt or .txt). It will be automatically recognized as a browser document. In my case, the icon turned to that of Mozilla Firefox.
