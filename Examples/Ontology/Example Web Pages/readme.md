Web Pages in html from [here](https://schema.org/docs/automotive.html#usage_examples): Pre-markup; microdata markup; and RDFa markup. 
How to create these html pages: Open Wordpad, copy and paste the document, and 'save as'  with the extension of .html (not .html.txt or .txt). It will be automatically recognized as a browser document. In my case, the icon turned to that of Mozilla Firefox. To download from github, right click on the entry and use 'Save Link as'. The saved document can then be dragged onto a web browser window to display. To see the underlying html, right click on the displayed web page, and choose 'View Page Source'.
