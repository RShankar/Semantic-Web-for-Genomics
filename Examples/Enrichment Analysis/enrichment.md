GO is used extensively for Annotation-based enrichment analysis. It is also called pathway analysis. Look at the 2010 paper on enrichment analysis software included in the Tools folder. 

I will cover two examples:

1. *SOD1/CCS* - two paralogous human genes from the SOD-related family. This is described in Goudet et al. "Phylogenetic-based progagation of functional annotations within the Gene Ontology consortium (Paper included under the Tools folder). They discuss PAINT (Phylogetic Annotation and Inference Tool), part of a family of tools developed by the [PANTHER]() group. Need to choose a mutation pertinent disease to show case enrichment 







Later action item: I will also incorporate information from "Expression Sequence Tags (ESTs): Generation and Analysis" By John Parkinson. The intent is to develop a few examples for EST, as pertinent to ECM (extracellular matrix), my area of research.
