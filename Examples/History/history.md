Ridley's book discusses Chromosome #3 from a historical perspective - on how Dr. Garrod in 1902 hypothesized the role of DNA mutation as the cause of a rare disease (alkaptonuria), treatable through dietary changes. It has symptoms of arthritis and discoloration of ear wax and urine upon exposure to air. In 1991, two spanish researchers created a mutated version of  a fungus (*Aspergillus*) and isolated a defective version of a protein (*homogenitisate dioxygenase*) and its corresponding gene sequence. They then mapped the gene sequence to the human genome, finding a match (52%) on Chr 3. Two SNPs in a sequence of 901 bp were found to be different in such patients, compared to normals. Double mutations suppressed  biodegradation of the specific protein, rendering the discoloration. 

In the 19th century, much debate raged on compatibility between Darwin's natural selection and Mendel's blending inheritance. Mendel provided the 'atomic theory' of biology. Darwinishm needed variation, while Mendelism provided stability. Mueller in 1926 exposed fruit flies to X-rays and caused deformities:  mutations showed that Mendel's particles (genes) have an internal structure that can be changed. This eventually won him a Nobel prize. Watson, who started out with Mueller at Indiana University, worked with Crick at Cambridge, on their common obsession that genes were made of DNA, not protein. Their complementary strengths in **biology and physics** led to the discovery of DNA's structure in 1950s and eventual Nobel prize. Mapping the 4-letter DNA code (ATGC) to the twenty known amino acids (through 3-letter codons) was known by 1965. This 'genetic code' won Holley, Khorana,and Nirenberg the Nobel prize in 1968.
