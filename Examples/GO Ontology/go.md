Figure 2 in Chapter 3 of the GO book is used as the starting point for this discussion. The Go identifier to track is: GO:0003993. Here is the screenshot within Protege, with appropriate tools and windows used:

A regulator example is shown in Protege for GO:0003991 here:

The same is obtained via AmiGO2 and QuickGO tools as follows:

Start at AmiGo2 [home page](http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/dd_browse). Type in GO:0003993 in the Quick Search box. Choose the first entry there. We will get a list of annotations (see below screens for all species and just for humans). Annotation is the process of assigning GO terms to gene products.

The screen below shows annotations for GO:0003993 just for humans. Note the filter entry on the left hand side:

To match up with the book's Fig. 2 in Ch. 3, I filtered by the 'contributor' (UniProtKB in this case). Result is this list of annotations (note that PHO3 is no longer listed - the book was probably written in 2016; now, in 2018, they have pruned the list):
