[Genbank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) is an online database maintained by NIH. Others: EMBL and DDBJ, in Europe and Japan, respectively. Accession numbers for some sequences, as listed on pp. 18 of Cristianini and Hahn (to be used in later examples):
* AF254446 - *Homo sapiens neanderthalensis* mitochondrial D-loop, hypervariable region I
* NC_001416 - *Bacterophage Lambda*, complete genome
* NC_000907 - *Heamophilus Influenzae*, RdKW20, complete genome
* NC_000908 - *Mycoplasma genitilium* G-37, complete genome
* NC_001807 New: NC_012920.1 - *Homo sapiens* mitochondrion, complete genome -- Start with [Homo sapiens genome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=Homo+sapiens+genome) 

To search for the first one, start [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/). Enter this in the seach window: Homo sapiens neanderthalensis mitochondrial D-loop . Hit the Search button. Pick the first entry (367 bp long). its accession number is listed there is: FM866397.1 . Genbank output is [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/FM866397.1?report=genbank). FASTA output is [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/FM866397.1?report=fasta). This 2009 version is longer by 22 bp, as compared to the book's version (pre-2007) and is from Spain (earlier one: from Russia). Fourth entry corresponds to the book's entry with an accession # of AF254446.1. This sequence has been used to determine whether humans descended from Neanderthals. Answer: [N0](https://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(00)80310-4). They used info in Mt hypervariable regions I, II, and III (regions: 16024-16383, 57-372,  and 438-574). See this [link](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/MtDNA_haplogroup_distribution_among_2%2C054_individuals_across_26_populations_from_the_1000_Genomes_Project.png) for geographical variations

The search function seems to be comprehensive and intuitive, unlike the link for genome [browsing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/browse/#!/overview/). I think it is case sensitive (did not accept homo sapien; accepts homo sapiens), and accepted a common term: Human. Here is the resulting [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/51).
