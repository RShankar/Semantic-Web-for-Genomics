The intent here is to summarize key books and papers relevant to the field. For example, the book ["The Genetics of Obesity"}(https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461486411) helped me make the leap from the excitement felt from GWAS papers ("I could now connect genotype to phenotypes" in my specific disease focus on atherosclerosis) to a realization of their limitations (statistical listing of candidate sequences, not verified by hypothesis-driven modeling and/or experimenation). Even modeling will require a high amount of annotation from earlier experimental studies for it to be considered to be a valid substitute for an actual experiment.
