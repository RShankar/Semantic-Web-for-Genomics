There is a very good chapter entitled " Extracelliular matrix gene expressionin the developing mouse aorta" by McLean et al., in "Exteacelliular Matrix in Development and Disease" edited by J.H. Miner, 2005. They studied the mouse aorta for RNA expresion profiles for 9452 probe sets (~ number of genes) from E12 to P60 to 6 months of life. They used hierarchical clustering to identify subsets of genes with four differing expression patterns during this period. They then used Go annotations to identify significant biological aspects using GO (to identify BP, MF, and CC aspects) for the top 15 or so enrichments. This is a good study for class use also. To be documented here soon.
