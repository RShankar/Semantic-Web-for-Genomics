Summary of HapMap 2009 paper on common and rare genetic variants: [URL](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/downloads/human/hapmap3.html)

They genotyped 1.6 million common SNPs in ~1.2K individuals from 11 global populations, and sequenced ten 100-kilobase regions in 692. Only common MAF>5% have been well studied; this study focused on SNPs and CNVs (they call them CNPs) in <5% of population.
