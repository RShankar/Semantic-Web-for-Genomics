This is a summary of Chapter 2 in Appasani's book, entitled "GWAS: A milestone in the road from genotypes to phenotypes."

Genetic architecture of phenotypes: Genetic diversity is mainly caused by mutation and recombination. Genetic drift and natural selection decide on their presence in the population. Genetic variation is either point mutation (SNP) or structional variation (SV). Recomb (or genetic reshuffling) - variability is increased by placing different variants in the same chr. As per Wiki: double strand break or gap initiates it - repair process leads to crossover (CO) or non-CO (NCO) of the flanking regions. This creates new combination of alleles. There are **hotspots** of 1-2kb length with >100 fold increased rates of recombination. *Recomb* directly impacts the Linkage Disequilibrium (LD). LD refers to correlation between alleles located at different genomic positions. It relates to haplotype - combination of variants along the same chr inherited together. In population studies, LD 'occurs' when some combination of alleles (and non-exonic SNPs) are found as haplotypes more often than by chance alone. The main cause of LD is the appearance of new alleles through mutation. Recomb reduces it (my addition: *and such hotspots also impact the length of the LD in GWAS*). High value of r<sup>2</sup>  is used to identify **tagSNPs** that best covedr genetic variation within LD blocks. 

African population has greater genetic diversity. Today, due to the large human population, vast majority of human Ps are rare (MAF, minor allele freq, < 0.05). Also, *rare variants tend to be confined to continental populations* because of migrationary patterns. However, most common variants predate human migration and are shared across populations (see HapMap 2009 summary). 

Some commments on [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_summary.cgi): A new SNP is assigned an SS# (SNP ID). Each SS is aligned to an appropriate genomic contig. They are clustered (with rc or ref cluster #) when new ss submission maps to the same position on the contig as an existing ss#. An rs cluster can initially have only one entry. Homoe sapiens build 38.3 (as of 10/6/17, the latest available for today's date of 2/10/19) has ~660K rs#s (clusters). About 380K of them are in gene. The db codes/identifies the SNP location thus: locus - within 2 Kb 5' or 0.5 Kb 3' of a gene feature - coded as L (13 or 15, depending upon the 5' or 3' side); UTR (mRNA-UTR) - in the transcript of a gene, not in the coding region (T) (53 or 55); intron (not in the first two or last two bases of the intron (L) coded as 6; splice-site (variation is in the intron but excluded in intron/L group) (T)  (73 or 75); variation in a coding region (allele info - with coding of 4x, x for nonsense/misense/frameshift -1/2/4); coding-synon (3).
