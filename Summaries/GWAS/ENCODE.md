The goal of [ENCODE](https://www.encodeproject.org/about/contributors/) (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) is to build a comprehensive parts list of functional elements in the human genome, including elements that act at the protein and RNA levels, and regulatory elements that control cells and circumstances in which a gene is active.... Regulatory elements are typically investigated through DNA hypersensitivity assays, assays of DNA methylation, and immunoprecipitation (IP) of proteins that interact with DNA and RNA, i.e., modified histones, transcription factors, chromatin regulators, and RNA-binding proteins, followed by sequencing.

The consortium is involved in additional ventures whose goals run parallel to those of the ENCODE project. 

modENCODE: The modENCODE consortium identified various elements in the genomes of C. elegans and Drosophila, including transcriptomes, transcription factor binding sites, histone-modifications and the occupancy of histone variants and histone modifying-factors. The consortium completed this work in 2012.

modERN: The model organism encyclopedia of regulatory networks (modERN) project focuses on identification of additional transcription factor binding sites in C. elegans and Drosophila. The goal of the project is to comprehensively map the binding sites for as many factors as possible. This project is ongoing.

[REMC](http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/): The Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium (ROADMAP) identified DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, and small RNA transcripts in primary human tissues.

GGR: The Genomics of Gene Regulation is a newly funded NIH project that will be hosting its data at this site.
