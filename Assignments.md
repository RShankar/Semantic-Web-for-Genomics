The following assignments have been decided based on my background in cardiovascular systems research. I have conducted human pilot studies that showed potential for a noninvasive method for early diagnosis of atherosclerosis, the cause behind heart attakcs and strokes. This was followed by primate case-control pathologic validatrion studies, both cross-sectional and longitudinal. A five-center clinical validation study came next. I have multiple patents; FAU has commercializied these results for a substantial royalty. I have been also well funded over the years on this topic. 

While the course focus is clearly based on my own biomedical background, atherosclerosis is a typical complex and common disease, with  biological pathways involved in its incidence, progression, and potential regression that are similar to other such diseases. Moreover, the methods learned and tools explored will provide knowledge that is transferrable to addressing other similar diseases, such as Diabetes, Obesity, Alzheimer's, and other cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, and (to some extent) Cancer. The skillset is also applicable to processes of aging and cell death. 

This course exposes you to a state-of-the-art flow that should prepare you for an exciting career in research at an university, application in an advanced lab/pharmaceutical company, and/or entrepreneurship on your own. Feel free to talk to me. I have experiences and successful tangible results to share and advise you based on them. 

These assignments require reading of a few journal articles and reviews. I will give you references to get you started. Google Scholar will be very useful. FAY can help you get any article free (through our subscriptions and/or Inter Library Loan). Feel free to have one-to-one discussions with me. 

I will set up **Github repository** for each of you. Please post your assignments at Github, so other students can review and learn. 

Assignment 1: Choose one of the atherosclerosis project topics below; determine gene and gene products relevant, using online tools. Learn the overall genome to phenome mapping as relevant to your topic. Write a 5 page report, as a regular conference paper (with sections as follows: Title, authors, abstract, background, methods, results, discussion, conclusions, references, and appendices)

Assignment 2: Continue with your chosen atherosclerosis project topic; determine gene and gene products relevant, but limiting to experimentally verified phenotypes, and explained with physiology/pathology. This is the minimal subset of the genes/gene products. Include comments on other studernts' Assignment 1 essays, as relevant to your topic.

Assignment 3: GO Enrichment analysis for the minimal set. Identify major GO BP, MF, and CC terms and develop an overall hypothesis of known and new (if any) biological mechahanisms that map the subset of the genome to relevant phenomes

Assignment 4: Same project topic; determine gene and gene products across all acceptable GO verification codes (which includes biological, statistical, and electronic methods). This is the maximal subset of the pathways. All should read each others' essays before proceeding to Assignment 4. Include comments on other studernts' Assignment 1 essays, as relevant to your topic.

Assignment 5: Apply GO for pathway enrichment analysis for your set of differential gene/protein markers. Expand search and narrow down. This may require the help of other students in the class. Do note their contribution in the assignment;  they may have to be either acknowledged or accepted as co-authors for the project report.

Project report: Your publishable final report. You and other students are the first and ensuing authors, with me (Dr. Shankar) as the last author. These may become chapters in a book and/or be published as individual conference papers. Either way, you will get full credit. All the work will also be published at a Github site on Genomics Analysis. 

Additional (not required for this course): You can also use R/Python for creating a 'reproducible research' report - researchers find such a report more useful; If you wish to develop a tool, talk to me. This will be useful for MS thesis/ PhD disseration too. 

Atherosclerosis project topics:
1. Blood cells, clotting cascade
2. Blood vessel - ECM, GAG, Collagen, Elastin, and HA
3. Angiogenesis in Cancer and Blood vessel development
4. Regulation - global and local homeostasis, NO, SMC, and Endothelium
5. [Metabolic Pathways](http://homepage.ufp.pt/pedros/bq/integration.htm)
6. Signaling pathways - growth factors, hormones, neurotransmitters, and extracellular matrix components are some of the many types of chemical signals cells use. These substances can exert their effects locally, or they might travel over long distances. Also see reference to cancer [here](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/signaling-pathway)
7. [Inflamamtion pathways](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/cell-analysis/signaling-pathways/inflammatory-response-pathway.html)
8. [Atherosclerosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis)
9. [Regression and Reversability](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4262135/)
10. Risk factors - genetics, smoking, exercise, diet, aging, and stress;  phenotypes - obesity, diabetes, hypertension, Triglycerides, and Cholesterol (HDL, LDL, and VLDL). Intermediary gene and gene products - telomere, repair, mitochondria, and cellular death. THis is a dynamic process topic and requires understanding of longitudinal studies such as the Framingham studies. There are multiple potential topics under this major heading.
