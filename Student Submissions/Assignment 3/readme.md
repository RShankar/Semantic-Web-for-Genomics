This assignment is yet to be announced. However, one student, because of his prior work with GO ontology, was able to undertake this. One obtains a much larger universe of GO terms. However, there are limitations with this approach. A majority of the annotated additions are of electronic in nature, based on algorthmic deductions, not experimental/clinical research studies. About 10% of such annotations seem to have been validated in the ensuing 5 to 10 years. So, while it is a good comprehensive list, by no means, it can be considered directly relevant or valid. Two other considerations: The GO terms, especially at the higher levels, are not tissue specific and generic. So, it is necessary to prune the list of gene terms and gene products based on tissue specificity. Also, research cannot be trusted unless and until it has been replicated. So, further trim the list based on if the study has been validated by others.
