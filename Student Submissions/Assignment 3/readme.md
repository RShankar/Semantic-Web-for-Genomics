This assignment is yet to be announced. It will involve the use of the GWAS catalog to find the larger universe of potential (or putative) loci for the specific disease/risk factor (plus similar diseases). Some of it probably has been incorporated into GAF. GO, as a consequence, may reflect some of these advances. But, do not start with GO. 

One student, because of his prior work with the GO ontology, was able to undertake this. One obtains a much larger universe of GO terms. However, there are limitations with this approach. A majority of the annotated additions are of electronic in nature, based on algorthmic deductions, not experimental/clinical research studies. About 10% of such annotations seem to have been validated in the ensuing 5 to 10 years. So, while it is a good comprehensive list, by no means, it can be considered directly relevant or valid. Two other considerations: The GO terms, especially at the higher levels, are not tissue specific and are more generic. So, it is necessary to prune the list of gene terms and gene products based on tissue and disease specificity. Also, research cannot be trusted unless and until it has been replicated. So, further trimming of the list based on if the study has been validated by others is essential. Also, note that the GAF may not be up-to-date vis-a-vis the list at GWAS catalog.
