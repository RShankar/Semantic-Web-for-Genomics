Exam Description:

This is a take home exam. 

Please refer to the folder 'Exam Documents' in the Files section. I have uploaded there  a chapter from the book: "Genetics of Obesity' by S.F.A. Grant. It documents all the Genome-Wide Association Studies as pertinent to obesity. Please study the chapter and make a list of the genes and gene products discussed.

Part 1.  Conduct a GO Term enrichment study and determine the biological pathways, molecular functions, and cellular components that are involved in obesity. Summarize into a 4-5 page report - 15 points. 

Part 2.  Obesity and cardiovascular diseases may overlap. Use your research topic as representative of cardiovascular diseases. Find ways to determine common pathways involved in both. Read more on such pathways. Develop insight on possible reasons for this overlap. Summarize into a 4-5 page report - 15 points. 

For both parts, report format is the same as that used in your first assignment submission. For part 2, there is no correct answer. It is possible you may not find any overlap. However, good due diligence is expected, both at the level of the determination of the overlap (smart use of the tools) and  and possible explanation for overlap/non-overlap (review of relevant literature).  

Combine both parts and submit only one report, in pdf, doc, or docx format.
