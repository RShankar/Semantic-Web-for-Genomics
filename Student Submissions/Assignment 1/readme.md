Assignment Description: This was on literature search for genes pre-GWAS relevant to their chosen topic
Addition on 1/22/19: This might interest you: Fleuren and Alkema: Application of text mining in the biomedical domain, Methods, 74 (2015), 97-106. I will include it in the Files section.

Original Assignment:

I will cover the GO ontology over the next two weeks.This review will prepare you for the next step of identifying GO terms and the biological concepts that the disease process maps to.

First, discuss with me and finalize your topic. The preferred list of topics is listed at the end.

Essentially, in this review, you will first read 2 or 3 recent review papers/ chapters (2008-2018) on your topic (I can help you identify literature references).  To the extent you can, identify genes (both experimentally verified and GWAS proposed) and gene products (proteins, hormones, enzymes, glycoproteins, lipoproteins, mRNA sequences, SNPs, indels, CNVs, etc). The more comprehensive it is, the higher chance for you to publish it as a stand-alone paper. Focus on review papers/ chapter summaries in the literature.Use Google Scholar for this purpose. You may find useful review chapters / articles at the NIH Bookshelf (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. . To understand the concepts, Wikipedia is also a big help.

I will discuss more all of this in the class.

Here is a more formal definition of the assignment:

Choose one of the atherosclerosis project topics below; determine gene and gene products relevant, using online tools, such as PubMed. Learn the overall genome to phenome mapping as relevant to your topic. Write a 5 page report, as a regular conference paper (with sections as follows: Title, authors, abstract, background, methods, results in a tabulated format, discussion, conclusions, references, and appendices).

Upload  a PDF document to Canvas. Also, either upload an editable version (as with MS Word) to Canvas or give a link to an online shared document (as with Google Doc) and share it with shankar@fau.edu. This would be a good idea to continue to improve in a collaborative manner and also add other assignments to the same folder later. My hope is that other students may review and add their own comments, so your list becomes more comprehensive.

Atherosclerosis project topics:

    Blood cells, clotting cascade
    Blood vessel - ECM, GAG, Collagen, Elastin, and HA
    Angiogenesis in Cancer and Blood vessel development
    Regulation - global and local homeostasis, NO, SMC, and Endothelium
    Metabolic Pathways (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.
    Signaling pathways - growth factors, hormones, neurotransmitters, and extracellular matrix components are some of the many types of chemical signals cells use. These substances can exert their effects locally, or they might travel over long distances. Also see reference to cancer here (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.
    Inflamamtion pathways (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.
    Atherosclerosis (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.
    Regression and Reversability (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.
    Risk factors - genetics, smoking, exercise, diet, aging, and stress; phenotypes - obesity, diabetes, hypertension, Triglycerides, and Cholesterol (HDL, LDL, and VLDL). Intermediary gene and gene products - telomere, repair, mitochondria, and cellular death. THis is a dynamic process topic and requires understanding of longitudinal studies such as the Framingham studies. There are multiple potential topics under this major heading.
