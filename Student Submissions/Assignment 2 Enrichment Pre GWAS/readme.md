Assignment description: 

Please follow the steps I covered in the lectures last week and perform GO Term enrichment analysis for the genes that you identified from the literature survey. If you have fewer than 20 genes, please read a few more recent papers and add to that list. I have communicated with each of you individually. Please follow my suggestions, if any, and update as pointed out. Identify any new biological pathways  (you can visualize with the Treemap at REVIGO) that were not evident in the papers you read earlier. Update the results section with a tabulated list of biological pathways, along with short descriptions.  Identify in the table  which ones were evident from your literature review and which are new additions. Read more on all the pathways identified and update your discussion section. Update all the sections of your paper as appropriate. Save it at Googledoc as the second version of your paper, or with a different title, based on the assignment title. Upload here also, as with the previous submission,  a PDF, doc, or docx document.  If you have not given me your google doc link, please do so soon (send to shankar@fau.edu). The 'Enrichment Documents' folder in the Files section has two more papers, on biological pathway modeling and a GO term enrichment application to cardiovascular disease. The methods section documents tools similar to the ones covered in the lectures.
