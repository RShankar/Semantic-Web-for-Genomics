Lack of understanding of a given domain can lead to inappropriate application of concepts, algorithms, and tools, to the detriment of the field. Other researchers are usually able to identify these misdirections, in course of time. As an example, The [GO ontology book](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-3743-1.pdf) used in this course  refers to the [ENCODE](https://www.encodeproject.org/) (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) project in this context. The project has systematically catalog biochemical activities across key areas of the human genome. From this data, they '[assign biochemical functions](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11247) for 80% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions.' Since this mapping was based on statistical studies, not experimental (hypothesis-driven) biological pathway manipulation, they should be considered 'candidate functions' not 'proper functions.'


On occasion, it may be the exact opposite - outright fraud by a well-known and respected specialist, as was the case with a Harvard professor who [claimed to regenerate heart muscle](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/health/dr-piero-anversa-harvard-retraction.html) from adult stem cells found in the bone marrow. Either way, both can cause harm to the field and require vigilance and humility from all the participants. 

We wish to briefly cite such published information here as a self-reminder that a claim must be accepted with a grain of salt until and unless it has gone through rigorous debate and robust duplication.
