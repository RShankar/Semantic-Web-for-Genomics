Included here are these:
FAU in OWL format- I can share this with you at WebProtege. The version here may get outdated as I add all of you into the ontology database as individuals (a term to identify instances of a class). I have attached my version as of 1/6/19
Pizza in OWL format - it is available on the web as pizza.owl. I have also enclosed it here. 
Go in OBO and OWL formats - too big to uploade to Github. Here is the link to obtain them: http://geneontology.org/page/download-ontology
